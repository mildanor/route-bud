# route-bud
Small backend based project for a hackathon built together with Abhishek Shetty in less than 6 hours. It's a node.js based app which allows you to enter your origin, destination and send it to a certain number as an SMS message. It then returns you an SMS with the recommended public transport route to take in Stockholm. It uses 3 different APIs for this.
Future improvements would include better error handling and hosting.
